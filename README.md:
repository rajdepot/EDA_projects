# Exploratory Data Analysis: Student Performance Dataset

## 1. Dataset Description

This project uses a dataset of 1000 student records. Each row represents a single student and includes:

- Unique student ID
- Demographic info (age, gender, course of study)
- Study habits (daily study hours, class attendance)
- Lifestyle factors (sleep duration, sleep quality)
- Access to resources (e.g., internet availability)
- Academic environment (facility rating)
- Exam difficulty level
- Final exam score (0–100)

The dataset is clean, consistent, and has no missing values. All values are within realistic ranges.

## 2. Objective

The goal is to:
- Understand the structure and patterns in the data
- Explore how study habits, lifestyle, and environment affect final exam scores
- Generate insights that can guide academic decisions or further modeling

## 3. Steps in the Analysis

1. Import libraries and load the dataset
2. Inspect and clean the data (types, duplicates, consistency checks)
3. Perform descriptive statistics for numerical and categorical features
4. Visualize distributions and relationships (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps)
5. Group-by analysis (e.g., by gender, course, exam difficulty)
6. Feature analysis to identify important factors for exam score
7. Demonstrate advanced Python techniques:
   - Lambda functions
   - User-defined functions
   - List comprehensions
